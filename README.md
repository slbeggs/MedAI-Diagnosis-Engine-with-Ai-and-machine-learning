**Disease Diagnosis With A.I and machine learning ("WebMd 2.0")**

**Introduction**

In today's world, having immediate access to medical insights is crucial. While platforms like WebMD have long served as a go-to for many seeking preliminary medical advice, I saw an opportunity to go a step further. Introducing our project, which can be thought of as a " **next-generation WebMD"** , harnessing the power of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to provide users with more accurate, comprehensive, and tailored insights about their health concerns.

**Mission**

The medical landscape is rapidly evolving, with technology playing a pivotal role. Early diagnosis is crucial in preventing severe complications. My inspiration stems from recognizing the need for a tool that can help individuals, especially in the early stages of diseases, when symptoms are ambiguous. My aim is to provide a user-friendly platform that offers insights based on trusted medical sources, making preliminary diagnoses more accessible and reliable.

**Project Description**

My objective is to cluster and categorize diseases based on descriptions, signs, and symptoms using advanced NLP algorithms. By diving deep into each disease category, users get insights that are more tailored to their described symptoms, ensuring a more accurate preliminary diagnosis.

**Data**

The project  relies on the "Professional Guide to Diseases 11th edition," a trusted reference in the medical domain. The book, with over 2900 pages of rich information, serves as the foundational data source.

**Features**

1. *Advanced NLP Algorithms* : Unlike traditional platforms, our system uses state-of-the-art NLP techniques to understand and analyze user inputs, providing more accurate results.
2. **User-friendly Interface** : Designed with the user in mind, our platform is easy to navigate, ensuring a seamless experience.
3. **Trusted Data Source** : Built on the foundation of a renowned medical textbook, our platform provides insights you can trust.
4. **Tailored Insights** : Get results that are specifically aligned with your described symptoms, ensuring personalized feedback.
5. **Hierarchical Analysis** : Further classification within clusters based on specific symptoms.
6. **Disease Clustering** : Grouping of disease descriptions for broader categorization
